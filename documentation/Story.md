# Every Open Source Project has its own story so here's ours.

Gupta Shrinath started the same idea in early 2020 at that time there was no design, test phase just started developing ( What a noob :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and the app was developed in native android. If you want to look at how miserable the project was click here (https://github.com/sarveshpro/Notes). Like he's all other projects he abanded this project too XD

This project got restarted during the global pandemic COVID-19 of 2020. This time the idea was to create an app that is
designed, tested, and published to get a full software development lifecycle experience.

## Design Phase (29 June - 30 July 2020)

During the designing phase of High Fidelity Ayush Patil, Nikhil Godbole, Aditya Chaurasiya, Samihan Sawant, Rupesh Vanneldas, Ashish Jaiswal tagged along communicating over discord, listening to songs, abusing each other, having a midlife crisis, helping each other ( There's a silver lining so don't worry ✌️).
